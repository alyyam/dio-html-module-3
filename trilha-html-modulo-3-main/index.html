          The series follows the lives of siblings Kevin, Kate, and Randall
          (known as the "big three"), and their parents Jack and Rebecca
          Pearson. It takes place mainly in the present, but uses flashbacks and
          flashforwards to show other significant moments in the family's
          history. Kevin and Kate are the two surviving members of triplets,
          born six weeks premature on Jack's 36th birthday in 1980; their
          brother Kyle was stillborn. Believing they were meant to have three
          children, Jack and Rebecca decide to adopt Randall, an
          African-American child born earlier that day and brought to the same
          hospital after his biological father William Hill abandoned him at a
          fire station. Jack dies when his children are 17 due to a heart attack
          from a fire. Rebecca later marries Jack's best friend Miguel.
