        <p>
          Money Heist (Spanish: La casa de papel, [la kasa ðe ppel], lit.'The
          House of Paper') is a Spanish heist crime drama television series
          created by Álex Pina. The series traces two long-prepared heists led
          by the Professor (Álvaro Morte), one on the Royal Mint of Spain, and
          one on the Bank of Spain, told from the perspective of one of the
          robbers, Tokyo (Úrsula Corberó). The narrative is told in a
          real-time-like fashion and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden
          character motivations, and an unreliable narrator for complexity.

        <p>
          Set in Madrid, a mysterious man known as the "Professor" recruits a
          group of eight people, who choose city names as their aliases, to
          carry out an ambitious plan that involves entering the Royal Mint of
          Spain, and escaping with €984 million. After taking 67 people hostage
          inside the Mint, the team plans to remain inside for 11 days to print
          the money as they deal with elite police forces. In the events
          following the initial heist, the group's members are forced out of
          hiding and prepare for a second heist, with some additional members,
          this time aiming to escape with gold from the Bank of Spain, as they
          again deal with hostages and police forces.

        <p>
          Parts 1 and 2 were filmed back-to-back in the greater Madrid region
          from January until August 2017.The pilot episode was recorded in 26
          days, while all other episodes had around 14 filming days.Production
          was split into two units to save time, with one unit shooting scenes
          involving the Professor and the police, and the other filming scenes
          with the robbers.The main storyline is set in the Royal Mint of Spain
          in Madrid, but the exterior scenes were filmed at the Spanish National
          Research Council (CSIC) headquarters for its passing resemblance to
          the Mint, and on the roof of the Higher Technical School of
          Aeronautical Engineers, part of the Technical University of Madrid.
          The hunting estate where the robbers plan their coup was filmed at the
          Finca El Gasco farm estate in Torrelodones. Interior filming took
          place at the former Locked Up sets in Colmenar Viejo and at the
          Spanish national daily newspaper ABC in Torrejón de Ardoz for printing
          press scenes. As the show was designed as a limited series, all sets
          were destroyed once production of part 2 had finished.
